## Personal Dictionary

Apply these corrections for legal terminology, formatting, and common contract terms.

**Entry Formats:** Entries may appear in several formats—interpret them as needed:
- **Explicit mappings:** e.g., `section symbol = §`
- **Single terms:** e.g., `Force Majeure` (correct any phonetic mismatches automatically)
- **Natural language descriptions:** e.g., `The term 'inter alia' should be italicized as '*inter alia*'.`

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

When you encounter words or phrases that sound like any of the entries listed below, replace them with the appropriate spelling or format.

After each correction, verify that the replacement was applied accurately and that the legal term is now correctly formatted; if not, make a minimal adjustment and recheck.
